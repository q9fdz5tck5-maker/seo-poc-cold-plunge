  <h2>Budget-friendly picks (quick answer)</h2>
  <p>When cost is a factor, look for simple, durable tubs that are easy to set up and drain. Collapsible and inflatable models often provide good value without sacrificing usability.</p>

  <h2>How to choose an affordable tub</h2>
  <p>Consider the materials, insulation, and portability. Vinyl or PVC tubs can be less expensive but may require more care. Ensure the size fits your space and that it’s easy to fill and empty.</p>

  <h2>Maintaining your ice bath</h2>
  <p>Even low-cost tubs need maintenance. Change the water regularly, clean the tub after use, and store it dry to extend its life.</p>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <p>Curious how long ice baths should last or whether budget tubs are safe? Most entry-level tubs are designed for occasional use; follow manufacturer guidelines to stay safe.</p>
