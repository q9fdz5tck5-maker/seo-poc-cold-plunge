  <h2>Can you do an ice bath without a machine?</h2>
  <p>Yes. You can fill a sturdy tub with cold tap water and add bags of ice or frozen water bottles to reach the desired temperature.</p>

  <h2>Tips for chilling the water</h2>
  <p>Start with cold tap water, then gradually add ice. Use a thermometer to monitor temperature, aiming for 50–59°F (10–15°C) for a moderate plunge.</p>

  <h2>Maintaining the cold</h2>
  <p>To keep the water cold longer, choose a well-insulated tub and place it in a shaded area. Add additional ice as needed during your session.</p>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <p>Wondering how much ice to use or how long to stay in? Begin with shorter sessions and adjust based on comfort, adding ice gradually.</p>
